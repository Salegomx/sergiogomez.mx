                    I'm a full stack developer with a passion for creating clean, purposeful, and user-focused digital experiences.
                    <br>My work lives at the intersection of design, technology, and real-world impact—particularly in the travel and hospitality space, which I care deeply about both personally and professionally.
                    <br><br>This site is a reflection of my journey so far: from coding front-end interfaces with JavaScript, jQuery, and SASS, to building and maintaining backend systems with SQL and ColdFusion. I also take care of domains, SSL certificates, and DNS configuration—because details matter, and I enjoy bridging the creative with the technical.
                    <br><br>Beyond code, I'm someone who learns through experience. I value curiosity, good questions, and meaningful challenges—whether that means exploring new cultures, working on side projects, or helping others grow. Here, you'll find a mix of my work, thoughts, and ongoing experiments. I'm always building, evolving, and seeking out what's next.
                    <br><br>Two quotes I live by:
                    <br>“Have less. Do more. Be more.”
                    <br>“Humility without ambition makes you mediocre. Ambition without humility makes you toxic.”
